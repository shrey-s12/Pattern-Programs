# Pattern Printing in C++

This repository contains multiple pattern-printing programs written in C++. Each function generates a different pattern based on user input.

## Features

 - Various pattern types: pyramids, diamonds, numbers, and alphabets.
 - Simple C++ implementation using loops and conditions
 
 - Easy-to-use functions.

## Available Patterns
The following functions are available:

- print7(n): Pyramid pattern.
- print8(n): Inverted pyramid pattern.

## Example Usage

```C++
int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the value of n" << endl;
    cin >> n;
    print7(n);  // Call any pattern function
    return 0;
}
```
